cpuloadblink

A simple C program for the Raspberry Pi to show processor activity through the
ACT led on the board.

When idle, the led will be 1 second on / 1 second off. The higher the cpu load,
the quicker it blinks.

Compilation
-----------
gcc cpuloadblink.c -o cpuloadblink

Usage
-----
sudo ./cpuloadblink
No options, this is a tiny, quick&dirty program, don't expect error messages !

Installation
------------
as root, just copy to /usr/local/bin
To run at startup, you can add "/usr/local/bin/cpuloadblink &" to /etc/rc.local
(before "exit" of course)
